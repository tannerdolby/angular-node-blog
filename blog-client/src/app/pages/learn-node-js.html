<h1>Let's learn how to start using Node.js</h1>
<p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

<h2>So what is Express?</h2>
<p>Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js</p>

<h3>Creating your first Express endpoint with Node.js</h3>
<pre>
    <code>
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 4000;

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.send("&lt;h1>Hello world!&lt;/h1>");
});

app.list(port, () => {
    console.log(`App is running on port ${port}`);
});
    </code>
</pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Learning Node.js is becoming quite a useful skill in today's development landscape. It's never to late to start learning something new!</p>
